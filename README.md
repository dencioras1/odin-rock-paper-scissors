# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is the third mini-project that I have worked on while doing the TOP.
Everything works as expected except for one issue:
For some reason when you initially open the 'index.html' file in chrome
and open the developer console, no messages appear in the console.
However the game still operates as expected.

After the first game ends, the entire console output gets displayed, after which
everytime you play another game it works as expected.
